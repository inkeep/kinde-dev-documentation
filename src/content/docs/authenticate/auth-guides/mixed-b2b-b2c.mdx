If you have an app or site that supports a mix of business customers and direct customers, this guide shows you how to set up authentication in Kinde to meet both these needs.

For example, say you run a finance business and you have separate sign-ins for accounting business partners and direct customers. Accounting businesses sign in with an enterprise identity, e.g. SAML and direct customers sign in with email and an OTP.

This topic explains how to create a simple, unified experience for both groups.

## You’ll need the Kinde Scale plan

To set up authentication for a mixed B2B and B2C business that includes multiple enterprise connections, you need to be on the [Kinde Scale plan](https://kinde.com/pricing/). This is the only Kinde plan that gives you access to the features you need:

- Multiple enterprise connections (e.g. SAML)
- Advanced organizations - for managing users and access for business customers

You get 5 enterprise connections and 5 advanced organizations included with Kinde Scale. You can add more, but costs apply.

## How to build a unified sign-in experience

A unified experience is where everyone signs in through the same sign in screen, and they are routed to the relevant workflow for authentication.

This simplifies the sign in experience for all your users, including your enterprise connections.

### Example of a unified authentication experience

This is what happens behind the scenes with the auth setup.

### Step 1: Set up auth for your B2C users

In this scenario, your direct customers will sign in with email and a one-time-passcode (OTP). To set this up:

1. [Enable email + code authentication in your business.](/authenticate/authentication-methods/passwordless-authentication/)
2. [Set email + code as the sign in method in your default organization.](/authenticate/manage-authentication/organization-auth-experience/)
3. (Optional) [Set an organization policy to allow users to sign up to the default org using an email address](/build/organizations/allow-user-signup-org/).

### Step 2: Set up auth for your B2B users

Authentication for business customers can be more complex, with additional security considerations and set up time involved. For example, a partner business may require employees to only access your web app using their business email and for authentication to be centralised with their own identity provider via SAML.

Let’s go through the process for setting up 5 SAML enterprise connections for 5 different business customers.

1. [Add 5 separate enterprise connections to Kinde](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/about-enterprise-connections/). E.g. EC1, EC2, EC3, and so on.
   1. Configure each connection with the domain information, including email domains in the [home realm discovery](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/about-enterprise-connections/#home-realm-discovery) field. You may need to ask the customer’s IT team for this information.
   2. (Recommended) Switch on the **Create user on sign up** option to [enable JIT provisioning](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/provision-users-enterprise/).
2. [Create 5 organizations](/build/organizations/add-and-manage-organizations/), one for each business customer (and connection), and select only [the relevant enterprise connection for each organization](/authenticate/manage-authentication/organization-auth-experience/).

   For example:

   | For this org…  | Switch on this auth connection… |
   | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
   | Organization 1 | EC1 (domain x home realm)       |
   | Organization 2 | EC2 (domain y home realm)       |
   | Organization 3 | EC3 (domain a home realm)       |
   | Organization 4 | EC4 (domain b home realm)       |
   | Organization 5 | EC5 (domain c home realm)       |

3. In each organization:
   1. Go to **Policies** and add the relevant domain to the **Allowed domains** field.
   2. Select **Auto-add users from allowed domains**. This activates JIT provisioning for users signing up from this domain.
   3. Select **Save**.

With home realm discovery and allowed domains set, when a user enters an email that matches the domain name they will be routed through that enterprise connection. There is no need for them to self-select which connection they belong to.

### Step 3: Enable authentication for your application

To achieve the above scenario, all the supported sign-in methods need to be switched on in your application. For example, switch on Email + code, EC1, EC2, EC3, EC4, and EC5.

## Optimize your auth flow

This unified model of authentication can be extended to 10’s or 100’s of organizations, all while maintaining the same sign in screen.

Other situations you can cater for include:

- [Adding MFA for an organization's users](/authenticate/multi-factor-auth/mfa-per-org/)
- Adding other [enterprise connections](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/about-enterprise-connections/) (e.g. [Google Workspace](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/custom-saml-google-workspace/) or [Microsoft Entra ID](/authenticate/enterprise-connections/azure/))
- [Auto-assigning user roles](/manage-users/roles-and-permissions/default-user-roles/)

## Enable both SSO and email authentication for a customer

If you need to enable both SSO and email authentication for a single customer organization, you can configure both methods to work together. This allows some users to authenticate via SSO while others use email-based authentication.

### Steps to enable both authentication methods

1. **Set up the enterprise connection for SSO**
   - Add an enterprise connection (such as SAML or OIDC) for your customer's identity provider.
   - Configure the connection with the customer's domain information using home realm discovery.
   - In the organization settings, enable the relevant enterprise connection.
   - In the organization's policies, add the customer's domain(s) to the **Allowed domains** field and enable **Auto-add users from allowed domains** to activate just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for SSO users.

2. **Enable email authentication for the organization**
   - In your Kinde application's authentication settings, ensure that **Email + code** (passwordless) or **Email + password** is enabled as a sign-in method.
   - Make sure both the enterprise connection (SSO) and email authentication methods are toggled on in your application.

3. **Configure user routing**
   - When users enter their email on the sign-in screen, Kinde will automatically route them based on their email domain:
     - If their domain matches the SSO configuration, they'll be routed through the enterprise connection.
     - If their domain doesn't match, they'll be able to use email authentication.
   - This creates a unified sign-in experience where both authentication methods work seamlessly together.
